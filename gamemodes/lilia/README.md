# Lilia
 
Lilia is a roleplay gamemode framework for [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/), built as a fork of [NutScript 1.2.3](https://github.com/NutScript/NutScript). Its aim is to provide a stable, feature-rich and open-source, allowing game developers to focus on creating engaging gameplay.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can visit the comprehensive guide in that we will leave at the bottom, which provides an in-depth tutorial on how to install the basics of the gamemode. However, if you are already familiar with the process, you can quickly create your own schema by forking/copying the skeleton schema available at [Skeleton Schema Repository](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia-Skeleton-Schema). This contains all the essential elements required for a functioning schema, allowing you to start coding immediately.

If you have questions or want to integrate with the community, you can join our Discord server at [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTcVq92HsH).

## Development

You are welcome to submit a pull request with any beneficial changes/fixes. Currently, there are no specific contributing guidelines other than ensuring that your code is consistent with the rest of the framework.

## Acknowledgements

Lilia is a fork of NutScript 1.2.3 by Chessnut and rebel1324, and we acknowledge their contributions to the framework.
